# Departmental Alumni & Project Portal (PWA)

A Progressive Web App (PWA) built to bridge the gap between current students and alumni. This project serves as a centralized hub for tracking placement activities, collecting alumni data, and fostering a professional networking environment within the department.

This project was initiated under the guidance of HOD Mr. Vinayak, focusing on a modern alternative to traditional native apps.

## Technical Strategy: Why PWA?

Initially conceived as separate web and mobile applications, I proposed a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** approach. This allowed for:
* **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: A single codebase serving both web and mobile users.
* **Offline Capability**: Seamless performance regardless of network conditions.
* **Installability**: Users can add the portal to their home screen without using an app store.
* **Reduced Overhead**: Lower maintenance requirements for the department.

## Key Features

* **Alumni Data Management**: Specialized forms for data collection to assist in placement coordination.
* **Project Insights**: A dedicated space for students to update project progress, providing visibility for placements.
* **Engagement System**: Interactive like and comment features to encourage networking.
* **Automated Notifications**: Integrated email system to alert alumni and students about departmental events.
* **Communication Hub**: Integrated contact forms for professional inquiries.

## Leadership and Team Management

Beyond the architecture and development, I took the initiative to form and lead a team of juniors. My role involved:
* **Mentorship**: Guiding junior developers through the MERN stack and modern PWA practices.
* **Task Delegation**: Assigning modules based on individual strengths and learning goals.
* **Sustainability**: Ensuring the code was documented and maintainable, allowing the juniors to continue improving the project post-deployment.
* **Strategic Planning**: Convincing stakeholders to adopt the PWA model for better efficiency and reach.
